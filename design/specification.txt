A program to run a slideshow from all images in a folder, and
sub-folders. 

The host is a static HTML page using css and javascript and has access
to a a folder of images.


The images should be display to the maximum of the display height and
width such that the entire image is visable. Possibly with a border at
some point.  

There will be a "what's this / how to" display of how to use
the app - which will appear until the user selects DO IT.  

There should be a params.json file where program settings
are stored.  These include:
	folderName:  the full path to the root folder of images
	displayTime:  milliseconds for for each slide
	
In the future there will likely be more settings.  At first this will
be maintained by hand - but maybe in the future it could be modified by
users using the app


Once things are working there will be a way for the user to interupt the
program by typing esc.  This will bring up a dialog overlapping the
image display for user to select from these options:

	- diplay the "what's this / how to" page
	- change display time for each image
	- pause the show and return to the image on the screen (until the
	  next esc
	- show image information:
		path/filename
		file size 
		creation and modification dates
		in the future this may include exif or other info
	- (not in initial prototype) add a row to a db with comment and filename
		possibly delete the file (other options TBD)
	- devloper information/ documentation

Once this is working it maybe be deployed as a standalone and also from
a larger web site.

The whole thing should be as perfect and simple and elegant as possible.

Notes/Questions

I think typescript can be stricter about type expectations and
notation then is javascript - but it maybe more combersome to develop in
typescript beause of the need to compile to js?


I'd like to see it coded in typescript unless there is some downside to
that.
